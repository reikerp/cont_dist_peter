```

This package contdistpeter currently contains two functions, rejection_sampling and d2_sampler_special.

```{r, include = F}
#library(contdistpeter)
```

## Description for the rejection_sampling Function:

Single variable rejection sampling is the main function of this project.
It recieves a function's pdf and generates a number of samples from the rv with the provided pdf using rejection sampling.
It is thereby somewhat similar to functions such as rbinom, runif, etc.

Input variables:

n is the number of samples to generate.

pdf is the pdf of the random variable you wish to sample from.

a is the lower bound of the random variable you wish to sample from.

b is the upper bound of the random variable you wish to sample from.

C is a numeric such that f(x) <= C for all values of x.

Return variable:

my_sample A vector containg the desired number of random samples from the desired distribution.

## Example:

```{r, fig.show='hold'}
# sample1 = rejection_sampling(10^4, function(x)1, 0, 1, 1)
# sample2 = rejection_sampling(10^4, function(x)2*x, 0, 1, 2)
# sample3 = rejection_sampling(10^4, function(x)exp(-x), 0, 10, 1)
# plot(sample1)
# plot(sample2)
# plot(sample3)
```

## Description for the d2_sampler_special Function:

Sampling from a 2D distribution given FX(x) and F(y|X = x) is the additional function of this project.
This function takes samples from a 2D distribution given the marginal pdf of X and the conditional pdf of Y given X = x.
Its output is in the form of a list where a sample from the marginal pdf of X is the first element.

Input variables:

n is the number of samples to generate.

fx is the marginal pdf of X.

fyx is the conditional pdf of Y given X = x (it is in the form function(y,x) expression).

Return Value:

my_samples is a list of samples from the desired 2D distribution.

## Example:

```{r}
# d2_sampler_special(10, function(x) {exp(-x^2/2)/sqrt(2*pi)}, function(y,x){exp(-y^2/2)/sqrt(2*pi)})
# d2_sampler_special(10, function(x) {ifelse(x > 0, exp(-x), 0)}, function(y,x){ifelse(0 < y & y < x, 1/x, 0)})
# d2_sampler_special(10, function(x) {ifelse(0 < x & x < 1, 1, 0)}, function(y,x){ifelse(0 < y, x*exp(-y*x), 0)})
```
